#About TOP(Thinking Oriented Programming)

###  TOP does make things easier.

#### To be honest, my coding in JavaScript is so bad that my lab4 can't achieve the goal teacher Wang set. In lab4, to achieve the target, I have to made use of some very stupid method to solve my problems but left many bugs, and both my codes' style and readability are not good enough. But from teacher Wang's code, I have to say that Top does make things easier.

#### During the Wang's live coding show last week, I watched how teacher Wang coding and tried to understand how to think oriented programming, and I found that this is just like C plus plus! When I tried to rewrite the lab4 with many new techniques like less, jade, livescript, things seems like to change. Though I still not totally understand the core of javascript, but I can think oriented and program fluently with livescript...(This may be not good...) When I achieve the target in lab4 without bugs, I consider that the TOP does make easier, and I'll try to acquire TOP one day...
